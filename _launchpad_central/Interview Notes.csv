Very small subset of people who read a long article, numbers declining dramatic (engaging on article is more difficult than getting them to read it)Product roadmap - not focused on collaboration but on discovery?Use log-in that is social in natureHow can you wow your professors between now and June 9th?

Tags? You can find that on the web (topic or genre) - do we even bother, featurette (not a gamechanger, Pocket could implement that easily)Social log in?How do you diversify away from building on top of a single platform?More you can aggregate data across other platforms, less platform dependent and less something Pocket can doOverlay social graph information to an article

Google —  I know everything I want will show uo             Science Daily —  I am interested in cutting edge science, easy to read and quick to read             Tumblr — I go on tumblr for pretty pictures but I also follow science blogs and political blogs             Twitter — Twitter is a great place, it has the most overarching perspective of things.                         Twitter is least bias because its individual bias takes…whole picture -What aesthetic qualities? Organization? Social factors? Etc                    Really really simple, love the new yorker magazine but i can’t read it… so much text and so stuffed                    Time magazine is easy to read and more white space but content.I want to power to filter what I see —  instagram, tumblr, and others have sponsored ads. I only wanna see what I choose to follow -Are their modes or situations that define which site you go to first?             If I want to be intellectually challenged, I will go to new yorker and read stores               Visual experience I will go to tumblr             Science things I go to science daily             General things I will go to google.             Facebook is increasingly becoming a source of news. Friends show me what they see on FB. -What are the factors that define these “modes”?Visual experience — bored on phone, avoiding interaction             Science daily — when I’m busy and don’t want to do work but need stimulation             Same for new yorker -What makes a source trustworthy? Attention grabbing? Relevant?             Tumblr — based on the # of comments and stories behind the comments                   personal stories really speak to me I share articles when i am face to face with someoneor I will send a link to gchat or kakao or groupme.Titles and visuals have to pass my test before I click on something.

I like to see what people think before I read the article-Will read article dependent upon comments-Likes videos a lotEMAIL-email subscriptions-when companies come out with new things she will get infoLikes to browse through a lot of articles in a short span-on sites like fast company (more designy, product innovation)-Used to bookmark some good sites and look at them like twice a week","Key insights
-Facebook is the primary source she uses to find articles because she puts more stock in her friends’ referrals
	-Will scroll through FB, making mental notes of articles as she scrolls.
		-stop scrolling when “It starts getting boring. Like when I’m scrolling too much.”
			-Took about a minute of scrolling to stop and go back
-Her order of influence for wanting to read an article: How many friends share it, Comments (if they are thought provoking), Topic, Title.
	-She went to read an article, but because of the layout chose to not read it. Then a friend posted a similar article and she went back 	to read the previous article.
-Likes to use other sources (2-3 times a week) because sometimes it is “nice to have a lot of articles to glance over quickly”
-Topic doesn’t matter THAT much to her, but will choose non-FB sources based upon topic.",Customer Interview,,Discovering and consuming new content from trustworthy social connections; Providing social context to article search results; Millennial news consumers; Easily discovering the thought-provoking content that matters to them

I’ve heard Aljazeera and BBC are good for america, but i dont spend time there because it doesnt interest me.

2015-04-05,"In Person Meeting with Morgan Kinney, Student, Northwestern University","Interview Guide (week of 3/31)MORGAN KINNEYTasks to be performed1a) Ask someone to walk through their 3 main content repository sites (the sites that they use to FIND content)Have them provide a running commentaryCustomized my Facebook - “did that all very consciously” liked publications, 
There's a lot of news in my news feed. I make a judgment call whether it’s a longer thing or quick thing (if it’s shorter I pull it up in app) or if it’s a longer feature or will look crappy on my phone I’ll use save it later (was a big user of Pocket, use Pocket for Twitter still), use the Save for Later featureI look at Slate - dumb article I would never click on, convincing millennials to marry a nice jewish boy - save links (wouldn’t read it immediately), video so would definitely save that for later (usually not in a place where I would open up a video unless I’m sitting doing homework or something)I always read everything I see from the Awl because the awl is really funny, usually pretty snappy stuffSometimes (I don’t use related articles a lot because it’s pretty shit) but will occasionally click on something, suggested thing is generally bad at giving me type of sites I would go to (weird alternative news sources, why weed smoking is good for you bro, I fucking love science weird spammy stuff) but if it links me to a reputable article from The Atlantic or a WaPo article there’s less of a risk it’s junk clickbait that somehow shows up on Facebook which happens a lotTwitter is the same deal - fall more people than news outlets, more interesting. Will be scrolling through my Twitter feed and Robinson Meyer will be tweeting about this thing and I’ll be like “that’s interesting I should read that”
TweetDeck - because people tweet the same thing in succession, I will go into the conversation thread and see the conversation people are having, if they’re talking about something awful TEd Cruz said it’s usually at the top and I’ll read that articleI think Twitter’s better at giving you self-contained information where I’d be less apt to click on it, has a pull quote on it - I can get the gist because that’s usually an important quote, I do fall for clickbait a lot, NYT has a pretty bad Twitter but will probably look at this Mad Men article because I want to know what Jon Hamm saidEspecially since people retweet stuff about it gives an extra layer of endorsement so if I see that (don’t care about this thing Diti retweeted), someone who is a comedian (Nicole thinks it’s funny and she’s funny) I’m retweeting this (funny screenshot “give daddy his podcasts”)I really like NYT Archives too because there’s literally no other way you would discover an article from 1961 about the Kodak slide project you get fun factoids from thereTwitter app, uses arrow keys to navigate (didn’t like the TweetDeck app, not power user, some lists but mostly using main feed)I have a tally in my head - if something has terrible social media I’ll give it 10 strikes and then I’ll unfollow them (about to follow the SUn Times because their twitter is so bad)My psychology professor followed me on TwitterStatus based - know who a person is and you’re attached to that RT because you RT’ed it, it’s a personal thing (generally more apt to listen to some people than others in your own network), like when Duner tweets “wow” i have to pen thatGo to homepage of exceedingly small number of news sites (The Atlantic, NYT)
Four months ago went to homepage of Vox and hadn’t seen it before, thought it was crazy. Says a lot about how I consume news - get it from secondary sources that link me to the direct story but don’t link me to the sections or homepage.NYT very much like a newspaper on a screen the way it’s laid out, way you read that I guess I usually just scan through it and it’s a good way to get what I want but with NYT I specifically go to the Science section because they have Science Tuesday and it’s really good (on Tuesday they have a beefed up science section)Try to go to the magazine but it’s a huge time commitment as much as I like, revamped the magazine I go there more often, have better looking stories, they finally have interactive things on  a more everyday basis like Snowfall or DasaniWhy NYT homepage not Slate? go to get the news, Slate’s more of a lifestyle thing, I value them for the weird things they talk about but those are things that bubble to the top of social media, even NYT twitter doesn’t tweet about the news, they’ll only do things that they think will do good on social media- Things to look for: What draws the user to these repository sites? What aesthetic qualities? Organization? Social factors? EtcOn a certain level that’s comforting I know how it works (Vox is visually overwhelming for me the way it’s organized, homepage is offensive because there’s so much going on, especially the way it looks different every time you refresh it, not the best way to use the screen, I see like three articles as opposed to NYT which I have different columns and it’s organized by video, I know where things are on that page versus dynamic and changing all the time)- Are their modes or situations that define which site you go to first?Only read long things at night when I have periods when I can read long things, especially since I work in the morning, in class all afternoon, otherwise I’m on the toilet or something and I can be sitting there for twenty minutes reading this piece of scintillating journalism, “scrolling mode” all the time (valuable for news consumption, it can happen when you don’t mean it to you just go on FB to see what’s happening and you run into this content you’re compelled to consume), eating dinner with someone extremely boring and start reading the news on your phone, somehow show up to class ten minutes early sit on this couch and read some news- What are the factors that define these “modes”?-What content sites are immediate “go-tos”?Facebook, Twitter, NYT, Vox, The Verge, Texas Trib but not as applicable since I dont’ live in Texas anymore, The Atlantic, The Awl is quirky about life, don’t really like WaPo or LA Times (hit or miss), Esipus (weird literary magazine), NPR! and specifically I read my home one (KUHF) so I can know what’s happening at homeI hate all network news would never go to ABC NBC CNN- How does a user define these? (frequency, quality, ability to browse,etc.)Author names are good, most news sites don’t ahve that great of a website so it’s not keeping me coming back it’s the quality of the content, shy away from NBC.com- What goes through a user’s mind in the time between recognition and conversion?What makes a source trustworthy? broadly defined term when I’m consuming news, journalistic sense are they telling me some semblance of the truth with a level of balance (intuition as you’re reading)Trust these sources that aren’t wasting my time, fine with clickbait if it’s compelling me to ask the question in my head but if it straight up lies to me that violates that trust, also a measure of whether someone who tweeted/shared it is good, if it is on social media, trust involved with person who shared it tooAttention grabbing? Some places use puns I’m a big fan of puns, really bizarre facts, big believer in images increasing engagement (butts article from The Atlantic, big butt peach caught my eye), when it has a title like that too, just things that make you ask a question that sounds interesting (asking questions, I want to know the answer)Do not like anything that is like 9 things even if it is a listicle I don’t want the headline to reflect that unless it’s something completely bonkers I’ll let it slide (9 has to accompany a joke, number styled things)Relevant?Inherently relevant (things happening you need to know about), quirky, wouldn’t know otherwise, presenting in a unique way1b) Let the user read articles they find interesting? Have them provide commentary.I would say a hunch that not many other people are reading the same thing (will share and talk about it), will only share something that is aligned with an image I want to project of myself (not Germanwings news, people would probably already know that, doesn’t make sense it’s coming from me, more likely to click on something that Nicole RT’ed it because I’m projecting a certain image of myself), what I do tweet is crafted in a sense to reflect me-Under what contexts will sharing an article spark discussion?What type of discussion do you like to engage in?If it’s something absolutely side splitting hilarious and bring laptop over and show it to people, if I share something on Facebook I’d only do it if I’d expect a large response or if it’s some magical pun or something, honestly if you’re shouting into the void what’s the point- Is this verbal, your opinion, or simple sharing?- What factors contribute to retaining a readers attention?Interesting, Slate just published this long essay (10,000 words on condoms) and thinking about it (how did it get through round of edits), drones on aimlessly so I do welcome personality and style in people’s writing but still you need to have a purpose and a lot of times stuff that’s boring is purposeless-How do they change their opinion of the source as they read articles?More critical, have devised a standard for what it should be and also as I become super intimate with sources I know these people, would be creeped out (David Pierce’s girlfriend and I think about him as a person writing this article), just getting a relationship with the person creating it1c) Pocket specific-What characterizes the types of content saved to people’s pockets?In their words, what are terms that describe what makes something pocket worthy?Twitter, has to be long (Medium - minutes metric, 10+ minutes, how long does it take me to scroll), otherwise would’ve read it then and there, things I want to keep track of (maybe use this for a class eventually, I know I’m going to be referencing this for weeks to come, so good I make sure I never forget about this, best of list)-What characterizes the content in people’s pockets that they actually re-read?Facebook more frequent than Twitter (when I’m there and I’ve been using i tmore often), some NBN stuff too (“this is important”, “this is something I never want to forget”-In their words, what are terms that describe what makes something worth actually reading?Sunday afternoon-esque, time period when I should read something (I read a whole lot of articles like this, I could spend that time reading a book but feels like I’m doing more, reading couple of articles rather than one book), videos to Pocket and FB (rarely in a place to watch video right there)-Under what circumstances will people re-read them?2a) Idea Introduction-First intro the idea of Tellascope and let the user run with it.-Ask them what they think of it?-Why is it interesting to them? Why would they use it?-Ask what they imagined it would look like (draw it out!)-Have them say what features they assume it has?

Why did you decide to use Pocket?I started commuting on the subway and would lose my internet connection but still wanted to read articles.
Why not one of its competitors?Had the best reviews, thought the design was cute, liked the Chrome extension button. How often do you use Pocket?
To add articles2-3 times a weekTo read articles3-5 times a weekTo organize articles (tagging, searching, starring)not oftenWalk me through a day in which you use Pocket.Morning/during the day/afternoon I’m usually on the app reading stuff that I saved. But I’m usually saving stuff when I’m at work, see something on Twitter or Facebook that’s shared, but don’t have enough time to read it so I save it. Or when I’m at home after work and don’t have the energy to read something I’ll also save it then. What features do you use most often in Pocket? (i.e. tagging, adding articles, reading, search) Why?Adding articles and reading. Because those were the two main things I was looking for in an app of this nature. Do you read articles in Pocket or do you go to the original source? Why?Read them in Pocket because usually when I have the app open it’s becuase I don’t have Internet connection. But if it’s an image heavy story sometimes I like to go to the original source because they don’t save that well on the Pocket app. What situations do you save articles to Pocket?When I don’t have time to devote to reading the entire article. What situations do you read articles from Pocket?When I don’t have an internet connection or remember I have articles saved.What do you like about it?It’s easier to track articles that I’d like to read than tweeting them and checking those tweets or in a notes file. What could be improved?Better saving on iPhones. It was super easy on my Android phone, like two taps. But to save an article on my iPhone it’s a huge hassle. I also wish it auto updated without me having to open the app. Sometimes I don’t open the app until I’m already out of an internet connection so it’s unable to retrieve the stories i’ve recently saved What frustrates you about Pocket?The above and also that photos sometimes get wonky. When you read a good article, how do you share it?I do use the share function on the Pocket app sometimes, but usually only if it’s a long feature or it’s still timely. But in general, I’ll share a good article on Twitter but an extremely good article will go on Facebook. Would you be comfortable sharing what you read on Pocket with others?Yep, why not. (if you could select articles that you’ve read)Are there things you wish you knew about your Pocket habits? (i.e. usage statistics)Data could be fun! Everyone loves data. Are there any occasions where you never read an article you saved to your Pocket?Yes, there’s some that are just sitting there that I tell myself I’ll *eventually* get to but am kind of unsure if I ever will haha.&nbsp;","sharing is a plus, articles get left because of a change in mindset",Customer Interview,Customer Segments,Avid online news consumers; Active Pocket users
2015-02-24,"Phone Call with Andrew Golis, Founder and CEO, This","AG: Andrew GolisNZ: Nicole ZhuNZ: If I could first just get the title and organization you'd like to go by?AG: Well for the next 10 days or so here, I'm still at The Atlantic, as Entrepreneur in Residence and we're in the process of kind of finishing This spin-off at which point I suppose I'll be the founder and CEO of This.NZ: Could you briefly describe This and what your goals were?AG: I spent the last decade almost now on the kind of distribution strategy side of media companies, both as a kind of business lead and as an editor, thinking about the way in which the distribution game is changing and the way in which people are relating to media in a different way and obviously, I in particular focused on the way in which social sites had come to be the kind of way people find __ and talk about the media they love and one of things that I'd become obsessed with was the way in which as powerful as that mechanism is - the mechanism to be able to kind of delegate your attention to people you trust and have them share stuff that they love with you - most of the sites that were in that business were kind of in that business as a kind of secondhand business. Twitter's really into the last conversation business, Facebook's really into friends and family business and they do media recommendations often very well but primarily as a means to their main business. So I think one of the things we're seeing over time is that that narrows the scope of the kinds of content today to do a good job of distributing and doesn't really capture the full range of things that people really love and the full range of things people would like to be able to share and find. And so I became obsessed, when I was brought here at The Atlantic and was even obsessed with it while I was running digital at Frontline with the challenge of having to create a kind of better intermediary between people and the media they love, both for curators to really be able to show off the stuff they love and for consumers to be able to find a higher signal to noise experience and so we tried to step into that space using this one-a-day thing to kind of flip the equation away from volume and towards quality, and get people the ability to really mark something as special if they share it and the ability to find good, just the people that they trust favorites' stuff and the product's got a ton of work to do and we know it's in its very early stage. But so far we feel really excited about how good the experience is in terms of the quality of the stuff that people are sharing and how engaged people are despite the variety of limitations that underly?? our product.NZ: How did you approach building and scaling the online community with This?AG: So we initially launched a kind of prototype sort of thing back in the summer. It was really kind of the same site you see now without the social functions, so there was no following and there was no thanks. All it was, was a single front page that everyone shared and everyone could create an account and share one link a day. The Atlantic Media had put in the initial money I've been able to recruit Ben peratta, a friend of mine who's a beautiful designer and the former of CEO of this site called Supply, and a really awesome studio in Brooklyn, Fictive Kin, to build this prototype and we've launched in the hopes to prove out that people would want to do the one-a-day thing, that that would be a kind of transformative experience. We saw that working really well but obviously in a limited way. There was no follow model, there was no feedback, and so we did just a little more work in October and pushed out the private beta - I think it was November 13th - there were 300 users on the site when we pushed it out who'd been playing with it since the summer and we had to manually every single one of them with an invite link. And from there we started to release invites periodically to users and grow the community. The challenge for a networked site is it's only as good as the people you who are there. On some level, the mechanics of the thing have some impact and we can do a lot of work to create the right structures for the interactions, but in a really big way, the thing is only as good as the people who are sharing and the people who are following you. That, I think, is everyone started this invite-only method. It solves two problems at the same time. On the one hand, if someone's showing up totally cold because they read an article about it or stumbled into it, they don't know anyone on the network, that's actually going to be a crappy first experience because they're going to show up and there's not going to be anyone there they want to hang out with and they're not going to be able to find people and they'll have the empty room effect. So it solves that problem - anyone who joins the site joins the site because they know someone using this site and therefore it may not be a totally full room for their particular network, but at least there's some beginnings of a network to form around them and have it be a good experience. And then of course, because the kind of network of my friends and the people I know who really love media, work on media, and spend a lot of time with it, there is already a community with a group of people who have people who respect their taste in media and people think that they have interesting things to say and so we were able to build a small community of people who really knew each other who all were there because they love this stuff. We need to keep it growing because as the network grows, as I said, it's only as good as the network you have around you and so continuing to push invites into the system so that new people can invite their network and onboard them will be the only way the experience works for them, but in so many ways, both to avoid the empty room thing and because the product is still so young and we have so much work to do to really polish it up and try and do a big PR push around it, this gives us time to build some of the larger stuff and be humble about what we're trying to do.NZ: So your original user base for this was people in the media space, people who work in media, or at least are exposed to it on a daily basis. How has that user base changed as the community has grown?AG: Mostly it's grown. Certainly some people try it and don't stick and that's part of the nature of these things is that usage grows but that doesn't mean everyone always sticks and over time, our learning in the first 6 months to a year of the company will be figuring out ""ok what can we do to make sure everyone sticks and it works for everyone no matter how good the network is."" It's certainly gotten more and more diverse. At first, because the fact that my friends write about politics and my wife's friends all write about feminism and I'm a nerd about digital media, the network was, and still is, pretty awesome if you're a digital media feminist who likes watching TV and movies. That stuff worked for the people around who first got invites and then invited your friends, but you start to see there's a little French-Swiss network of people who are sharing in French, and they're inviting their friends and then you start to see kind of subcommunities start to bubble up and that's the exciting thing, is when it goes from being a monoculture - ""ok we're all interested in the same thing"" - to just a platform and anyone who wants to use it who has any set of interests and a network to move onto it can use it to find stuff around fashion or fishing or finance or I'm thinking of things that start with F.NZ: How has the mission of the site also changed since you've launched?AG: The way we've talked about it is ""the best of the web."" And I think that Youtube is one of the most popular source URLs. I just, today, shared a podcast. We are certainly focused on media and certainly text media is obviously the vast majority there is on the site, in some ways it's the most optimized for text media. But there's also, Medium has its cartoon section The Nib and Matt Bors, the editor is very active and they have an account that is very active and is one of our recommended users and that's one of the fun things in which a certain kind of visual stuff pops up. I have become, because of the site, super fascinated by GIF art and cartoons and things that are kind of evergreen in their nature but the visual and media not necessarily just pure text.NZ: What are some of the biggest challenges you've faced built This - either related to working within The Atlantic, getting the site up and running, iterating on feedback?AG: The Atlantic's been really supportive and basically made the thing happen. They brought me in in a generous way as a kind of executive without a particular portfolio which led to me building the thing. I think that the biggest challenge in anything like this is that you're making it up as you go along, or at least I am. I've never raised an angel round before or managed and built a network community before. I've kind of decided to throw myself off this cliff and figure it out. You have a lot of humbling moments where you realize you've done something stupid or you've just been thinking of something the wrong way. In general, as I've started to build the network of friends around me who are also sort of experienced with startups, you realize how much it's - the whole thing feels like it's going to die 15 times before it's permanently alive and you just kind of have to keep riding that rollercoaster. I just learned to have a stomach for that and know. You just keep improvising.NZ: This is more of a technical question and maybe it's for the sake of getting the prototype out in front of users. Why did you decide to make This a desktop vs. mobile experience, at least in the early stages of the product?AG: So the main reason is because it was going to be cheaper both to build and play around with. The second reason is that it can actually be quite difficult to jumpstart a sharing economy purely on mobile. From talking to people who had done these kinds of products, they always found that even though the vast majority of consumption and even later resharing happened in mobile apps, and especially at the beginning, a lot of first shares start on desktop. In particular, my community is that community of media people and people who are sitting in front of their computers making media all day and so my attitude has been ""start with what the best user experience is going to be  for cheaply understanding how to get the curators who we are targeting to be able to share quickly and generate a lot of that starting material"" and then we're going to basically ship from there and go build our mobile apps because we do know that clearly that's going to be the majority of the consumption.NZ: Currently there is following and sharing. Are their other ways you'd ideally like people to engage with each other and what people are sharing?AG: There's two categories of work to be done. One of them is just a lot of polishing and clean up work on existing features, so there's a lot of little stuff that we just didn't have the money to get to in the early days, like we need to have user search and we need to clean up a lot of the simple stuff to make sure the experience is good and make sure the kind of discovery and sharing is really lovely. The next thing after that - I am really interested in discussion, I have an instinct as to how we'll attack it, I do think eventually we'll need to start letting people talk to each other. I'm very wary of group public chat. I just think that one, if people are going to do group public, there's a lot of good places to do it, and two, even though group public has become the default mode of the internet, it actually is the worst form of conversation in real life. So it's kind of odd to me that so much of media conversations, conversations around media, have to be group public because they can fall apart so quickly, be derailed. So I'm really interested in intimate conversations and that feels like it might be a good fit for people sharing stuff that they're really passionate about. We probably won't tackle that for a little bit longer. That's some more basic work to just get the thing polished up before we get to there.NZ: How many users does This currently have?AG: 7600NZ: I saw that today you guys put out that article about the breakdown of all the links that have been shared on This since it launched.AG: Isn't that cool?NZ: Yeah that's really cool, I didn't realize how many news sites are being shared on This, which is awesome.AG: I didn't either. I some instinct but I haven't actually had the time to go and do that kind of analysis so I've been in contact with that guy and so appreciate it was so fascinating. NZ: What have you paid the most attention in terms of growth so far?AG: Like I said, I think growth at this stage is necessary to the extent that it is allowing people to form the networks they want to have the kind of people around them that make the product valuable. But both because the product is so young and because I think we've got a lot of work to do, both in terms of it's still a little stuck together with duct tape and bubblegum, and because it's young in terms of we need to still polish up the features. I don't think we need to ""are we going to get to a million users"" - that's not even close to anywhere near my thinking. What I'm trying to understand is what the right feedback loop to make people feel like it's a good experience. For example, I keep a really close eye on both the average of Thanks per link and the percentage of links shared on any given day that get at least one Thankso n the assumption, although we're about to do a deeper analysis of whether this is true, that that number represents the number of people that will continue to share because they'll feel like ""ok I was shouting into the abyss, I got some feedback."" Another thing I keep a careful eye on is, probably this week we'll cross 100,000 total follows within the site, and to the extent that you get that you sign up and you share a link and then someone thanks you for that link, that's probably because they follow you, and so if you have that completed cycle and it could also probably be because that person has started to build that network. Making sure people are building those networks and finding people to follow is really important.NZ: I know in some previous interviews you've talked about how This is a fight against this constant stream of information that we get from Facebook, Twitter, and other social media sites. How do you plan on encouraging on the site as it grows without turning that ""All"" shared articles tab into another stream?AG: People don't actually look at that much. Also the logged in homepage gets about ten times the amount of traffic on any given than the ""All"" does. I'm assuming that there'll just be a point when the All will be useless and it'll just go away because it'll be a process of, like other follow models. We may play with giving users the ability to categorize, tag stuff so that we can do discovery there. We may play with finding ways to recommend users to follow. All that stuff other sites built around this model experimenting this. I think that the follow model and the one link per day will maintain the core signal to noise, that that combination is what we built the solution around. It's certainly possible that at some point some user decides they're going to follow 10,000 people and then that's, you know, you can't solve every problem. But this to me feels like what we're encouraging our power users to do is come up with something really good to share and that feels like it's different from what other platforms are doing because there is such an incentive to volume on other platforms where it's literally just the more stuff you put into the system the more likely you are to build your following. Which I think for those networks probably over time means that they just bake in their own slow degradation.NZ: What social aspects are you leveraging in This to influence smarter news consumption or sharing?AG: I think what I'm trying to do is more approximate to a social magazine as opposed to a news ticker. The one a day really does, and maybe you or said this in that interview that Simon Owens did, is that most commodity news comes out of the thing when you only have one thing to share a day and so you end up with something that's more approximate to the magazine experience. God, I love the social sites we have now for the things that they do, but as powerful as the mechanics of social are, I don't really feel like if I think to myself ""I'd really like to read some beautifully told story where should I go that's a kind of front page for the web"" or ""I'd really like to read some interesting deep arguments"" or ""I'd really like to watch a high quality piece of entertainment."" The social web doesn't feel like it's solving that problem yet, but the mechanics of it are so powerful that it feels like it could. That's the aspiration that I am attacking - is that more like ""when you pick up your mobile device or your computer at 8 o'clock and you're sitting on your couch and you're thinking what am I going to look at, am I looking at a magazine or a newspaper or picking up a book or turning on the TV, what's the kind of magazine experience on the web. That's what I'm trying to build.NZ: What has been your experience so far regulating behavior on This? If that's even been a problem so far with the communityAG: It hasn't been a problem so far. Now that you've made me say it, I've jinxed myself. I think on some level, we'll have to start to do that over time because people can't directly engage with each other in terms of messaging each other, we haven’t had to figure out a system to deal with abuse yet. The community is small enough that we haven't had to manage an influx of spam. I'm sure it's all a matter of time but so far, it's one of the advantages to doing it this way in terms of the slower growth and private. We can attack those problems once we've got the core product in place. We're not going to have hundreds of employees to put out five fires at once. So to the extent to which we can pace ourselves and at first see if we can get the core thing right, then let's figure out if it grows, that'll be better.NZ: In the last year, there's been this return of email newsletters and podcasts and even news sites like The New York Times will send you emails with ""things we're reading"" today and I really enjoy getting those emails about the 5 best links from This. In the long run, how do you think This is going to compete with news outlets specifically which have also started to get into this idea of bundled content and personality-driven content?AG: I think about This as something that's trying to take that newsletter impulse up to scale. If the newsletter impulse is ""I'm a curator, I'm Alexis Madrigal or Ann Friedman, and people are interested in the things that I have to say and it gets drowned out on other platforms and I can put together a more beautiful curated list in a newsletter"" and then on the flipside you're a consumer and you say ""Oh God I can't keep up with everything and I want to just be able to give a couple people access to push things to me."" I'm one of those people, I definitely use those things, I love them. I think that the challenge is that on both sides, it's hard to know how far that can go. On the one hand, not everyone is going to have the time - like I do a newsletter every night and I'm married to someone who does a weekly newsletter - it can be time consuming even if it's a Tinyletter to manage it, get people to subscribe, put the thing together every week. And if you're a consumer, there's a point in which as you sign up for these things you start to create the problem that you're trying to solve which is suddenly you subscribe to 20 newsletters. I don't think that the best newsletters can be replicated or taken over by This, but I think on some level, the impulse if you're trying to curate a list of things that are a little more special, and if you're a consumer who's looking to get that more curated system but you don't have to be able to go through the hoops of, if you're a curator - creating a newsletter, or have to go through the painful process of signing up for 15 newsletters and you can just centralize all of that in one place. That would be the ideal. I think of those things - the retro cool of newsletters as a kind of proof of hunger for someone - and I don't know that we have yet, but for someone to solve this problem.","if someone is showing up totally cold, don’t know anyone total (crappy first experience) empty room effect (anyone who joins the site joins the site knowing someone using the site, may not yet be a totally full room but there’s a beginning of a full network)",Customer Interview,,Avid online news consumers; Discovering and consuming new content from trustworthy social connections

2015-02-22,"Email with Katherine Mirani, Student, Northwestern University","1. How did you first hear about Pocket?
I don’t remember how I first heard about it. It was probably from a friend, or in some article about apps that I read.2. Why did you decide to use Pocket?
I had been wanting to use an app to save articles to read for later, since I always see things I want to read but can’t read them right that second. I think I downloaded it this past summer, when I was right at the beginning of six months of working in downtown Chicago. I was commuting for a few hours each day by train, so it was really nice to be able to save up all these articles to read while riding the El. Articles on Pocket can be accessed without the internet, so it was great for when the train goes underground and you lose service. It also keeps my data usage down and doesn’t use up too much battery.3. Why not one of its competitors?
The only other one I had really heard of was Instapaper, and that cost money. I didn’t feel like I needed any of the special features Instapaper had, so I went with Pocket. When I told my dad I had gotten Pocket, he seemed worried that free Pocket doesn’t have a backup feature and that if something happened to my phone I would lose all the articles I saved. But I’m not that attached to my archive — I just like having a bunch of articles on hand all the time.4. How often do you use Pocket?
- To add articles
- To read articles
- To organize articles (tagging, searching, starring)
While I was commuting, I was adding and reading articles on Pocket multiple times a day. Now I probably add/read articles every few days. When I have way too many tabs open on my browser, I’ll unload some of the articles into pocket. A few times a week when I’m waiting somewhere or have some downtime I’ll open Pocket and read some of the stories. I don’t organize articles much at all (I think I’ve only starred one, and it was by accident). I use tags minimally, to have easy access to the recipes I save on Pocket (they are tagged “recipes”). I don’t tag or categorize articles at all.5. Walk me through a day in which you use Pocket.
This will be pretty similar to my answer to question 4, but I’ll go on pocket when I have a few minutes to spare. When I’m waiting for a meeting to start or for a friend to show up, when I’m taking the train, or when I’m just lying in bed on a lazy morning, I’ll open Pocket and read some of the stories I’ve saved up. A lot of times when I’m checking Facebook or Twitter but don’t have a lot of time, I’ll see an interesting long read and will save it to Pocket for later. Sometimes I’ll plan to cook a recipe I have saved on Pocket, and I’ll search my archive for the recipe.6. What features do you use most often in Pocket? (i.e. tagging, adding articles, reading, search) Why?
I use adding articles and reading the most. For me, Pocket is just a place to store articles I want to read at some point. Anytime I see something interesting and don’t have time to read it right then, I save it to pocket, and anytime I have extra time I have a big collection of reading to work on. Pretty much everything I save to Pocket is a “longread” or a recipe. I save longreads more than anything else.7. Do you read articles in Pocket or do you go to the original source? Why?
If I’m on my phone, which I almost always am when I use Pocket, I read the article in the app. This is because it uses up way less data and battery, and it’s stripped of ads and other distractions. Sometimes I’ll go to the original source if something was wrong with the formatting in Pocket and I want to see a particular photo or graphic that didn’t show up. If I’m killing time on my laptop and want to read some Pocket articles, I’ll go to the original source because that’s easier to view on a laptop.8. What situations do you save articles to Pocket?
If I see a good longread or recipe I’ll save it to Pocket. I usually don’t care about shorter articles enough to save them to Pocket.9. What situations do you read articles from Pocket?
This was answered above.10. What do you like about it?
I like its simple design — just the story, no distracting ads. I also like that you can read articles without internet, and that it seems to use very little battery. It’s an intuitive app and I was able to figure out its features easily. I liked that Pocket made it easy for me to turn off features that I didn’t like, such as the page flipping feature and the scrollbar.11. What could be improved?
I wish there were some way for Pocket to save all of a paginated article in one page. A lot of times, if a story doesn’t have a  “read all on one page” button, I’ll have to save each individual page to Pocket, which is frustrating. It would also be nice if there were a way to change the font of the story, but that’s not super important to me. It would also be good if they could form some kind of partnership with Facebook — currently I can save links directly to Pocket from both Twitter and Safari, but on Facebook I have to copy the link and paste it into Pocket.12. What frustrates you about Pocket?
Really only the inability to save paginated articles all in one go. I’m sure that’s a tough thing to figure out, but it’s frustrating for me as a user.13. When you read a good article, how do you share it?
I never share though Pocket. I’ll go to the original source and share that link on Facebook, Twitter or both.14. Would you be comfortable sharing what you read on Pocket with others? (if you could select articles that you've read)
Yes. I already end up sharing a lot of the articles I read on Pocket individually, so I would be comfortable with that.15. Are there things you wish you knew about your Pocket habits? (i.e. usage statistics)
At the end of 2014, Pocket sent me an email saying I was in the top 5% of users and gave me some statistics on how many words I had read, which days of the week I use Pocket the most, and what my most saved topics were. I thought that was cool, especially seeing how many words I’d read. It would be nice to be able to access that information anytime.","Situations for using Pocket (and consuming news): daily commute

2015-02-19,Email with Peter Wilson,"Questions:
Is the name on the tile (under the title) the author or the friend who shared it. Both are useful. If it's the friend you should show a picture. How are tiles ranked? Can I change this ranking (ie relevant, vs. timely, vs. social context)Random cool features/suggestions:
Generally I'd like to see much more context on the tiles, presented well, to help me decide whether I should read the article. For example:
Name of author, friend, publication. photos/logos would also be good.Time published, Time to read. (I stole this feature from slate). I'm sure you could work out an average read time by removing outliers, normalizing by device, etc.
 Top tags (ie what is this story about)
Can you pull a snippet from the publication to display in an interstitial/expando. For example (from your demo):
Partisan Lines Drawn in Congress Over Immigration --&gt; ""Republicans prepare to sue the President, while Democrats join together against protest bill.""Vaccine deniers: inside the dumb, dangerous new fad --&gt; ""Why a San Francisco community is disregarding mainstream medicine and putting its children at risk""Social context: How many of my friends have read this article (I don't want to be left out vs. I want to be ahead of the curve). How many of their friends. Some measure of quality. You talk about a ""worth it score"" based on voting, but 
I would suggest you could automatically calculate this by a combination of: #clicks, clicks weighted by social context, reshares, long vs. short clicks (ie how many people actually read the story vs. hitting the back button), freshness, etc. I'd bet that behavior will give you a more accurate measure of ""worth it"" than asking users to vote Adding in social context here, you could come up with a score that expresses ""how likely are you to discuss this at a cocktail party this weekend"". Can you show text stories in situ rather than navigating away from your site?
Forcing the user to navigate away is terrible for engagement. Especially on mobile. Open the webpage in an iframe.I think this would make a big difference, along with showing summary in the tile, to making this a destination rather than a step in the journey.Your search seems pretty broken...
Searching by tags is generally confusing. For example:
I typed in cancer (which appears in the 6th headline) and got no resultsI typed in Newsweek (which is the 8th publication) and got no resultsYou should index tags plus title plus author/friend/publication (plus full text of article?) and then rank the results based on relevance (ie search string in tag vs. title vs. content, freshness, etc.) Remember: search is a ranking problem, not a retrieval problem :)Be thoughtful about how tiles are ranked and how the user can control this. 
For example if you see an article fly by on your Facebook newsfeed it's pretty much gone if you don't read it then. You should be smart about ranking, but also allow browse/sort/filter (in some user friendly way) so that old articles are findable with reasonable effort.I like the UI on iPhoto, where you can view by date ranges today, yesterday, last week, etc. The tile interface is cool, but would be cooler if it was more interactive. For example:
Navigation/Filtering:
I'd like to be able to click on names, publications, tags etc. as a way to filter or sort content. I'd like a ""more like this"" link -- maybe something like ""5 related storied in your feed""Think about how you are going to drive engagement. 
I would like to see this constantly updating, showing me new things, demonstrating that if I navigate away I will miss something.There are a number of ways to do this. I like the FB/Twitter version of putting a ""pill"" at the top of the feed saying ""x new stories"". ...but it's also important not to jump around visually otherwise the user will lose all context on where they are.Personalization. This is personalized to me, but how would I know? Personalization is the key (imho) to making this stuff addictive.
Time: 
How about when I open it adding a feature that summarizes activity while I was gone.For example: ""Hello Peter, you missed 82 articles while you were away. Most were about Vaccines and Outbreaks. Don't worry - I saved them for you. Would you like to read them all now, or read just a sample I've selected for you?"" Place:
Is this location aware, both in terms of content, publication, and friend location. ie when I'm in New York I'd like to start seeing a tag for New York (maybe)Social Context:
How many of my friends are online, how many are sharing (ie how much am in the center of things)How many of my friends read what I share (ie how much of a leader am I)Think about having a rewards mechanism (ie a like button) so that I get my endorphin shot for feeling like a leader in my community, being connected, being respected, etc. etc.My interests:
I assume you have this covered.But also... don't ignore the value of:
Things my friends are interested in that I didn't mention. I imagine gender plays a role in this...Serendipity, especially of things that are broadly interesting. I imagine everyone is interested in John Stewart leaving TDS, or the Seahawks screwing up the superbowl, Other media types
What about audio and video? Can you show these on your site without having to click away?Mobile
The site looks pretty bad on my iPhone 6 :/Navigating to a new tab to read a news story is not a good mobile experience.","3 key ideas for us to think about:

2015-02-03,"Email with Andrea Park, Student, Northwestern University","I'm a 20 year old student at NU, where I work as a campus tour guide. My family consists of my parents, three brothers (ages 14, 23 and 25), one sister-in-law (also 25) and myself. I like to watch TV, go to the movies, shop online, read, write, cook and spend time with friends and family.Before I get out of bed in the morning, I usually do a quick skim of Facebook and Twitter via their iPhone apps. I gather a lot of news from the publications I follow on both platforms and occasionally click on news stories that interest me so I can read more about them. Later, between classes and after dinner, I spend a lot of time on various social media platforms (on both my phone and computer), and I gather most of my news from the publications I follow and the articles my friends share. I probably spend an hour or two each day reading just news. When I'm reading an article, I'm usually proud of myself for taking an interest in the news and intrigued by whatever I'm reading. I read articles from the New York Times, the Daily Beast, CNN and then also bloggier sites like Bustle and Nylon.I like to bring up current events when talking with my friends and family to get their opinions on the matter or help shed more light on the topic.My favorite news sources are ones that cover an entire story--ones that don't leave me feeling like I'm missing something. I also usually get pretty annoyed when an article is blatantly biased in a major way; I prefer to be presented with a balanced account of both/all sides of a story so that I can form my own opinions on the matter.I read a lot of articles from the New York Times, USA Today, Huffington Post, BBC News and think all of those places do news pretty well.I hate super lopsided news--outlets that basically tell you which side to support. It makes it difficult to get the full story, but I solve this by seeking out other sources covering the same story in a different way. I also typically stop reading the overly biased sources.While I think it is important to stay up to date on U.S. and world affairs, I find myself more drawn to entertainment/celebrity news.If I hear about a topic and want to learn more, I usually go to Google News and read a few articles on the topic there in order to learn more/form my opinion about the topic.Just today I read this article about how Harper Lee, author of To Kill a Mockingbird, is releasing a sequel to that novel, 50 years after the original release. I found it super interesting because of both the timeline of the releases and my own love for To Kill a Mockingbird. (http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/harper-lee-published-july-28687808) Usually the first thing I do upon finding an interesting bit of news is share it with whoever is nearby. For example, after I read this article while I was eating lunch, I talked about it with the friends with whom I was eating. If I'm not around anybody at the time I'll either post it on somebody's Facebook wall, text it to them or bookmark it so I can show them later.When I share the news with others, I usually feel educated and engaged in the news, as well as interested to hear their opinions on the matter.The only topic about which I would claim any amount of expertise is that of celebrity and entertainment news. I occasionally blog about entertainment topics for various campus blogs and I often discuss these topics with my friends.","How might we recreate the experience of ""sharing with anybody around at the time""?",Customer Interview,,

2015-02-03,"Email with Anne Li, Student, Northwestern University","
Tell me a little about yourself (age, job, family members, hobbies/interests): I am 20 years old (21 in a few weeks). I am a student at Northwestern University and an undergraduate fellow at the Knight Lab. My family comprises three people - myself, my dad and my mom. In my free time I enjoy quieter activities like reading or grabbing coffee with friends, but I love watching broadway shows and going to events in Chicago.  Walk me through your day in terms of how you get information about the world and your media habits? I try to start the morning reading Flipboard - afterwards I depend on Facebook and Twitter for news. At home, I listen to NPR religiously in the car. Sometimes when I'm board I visit the homepages of news sites. How do you get your news? (i.e. newspaper, TV, radio, online, mobile apps): Flipboard, Facebook (usually NPR, NBC and BBC), and Twitter

How do you feel when consuming media?: I feel rushed because usually I am multitasking or don't have much time to read a full article (I tend to click on feature articles more than brief news pieces). Sometimes I don't click on news about topics I ""know"" I don't have time to understand (Israel and Palestine, etc.). How long will you spend on reading news?: I will spend 5-10 minutes on a good feature story. Up to one minute on a news story, but if it's breaking or interesting I might spend 5 minutes clicking on many articles on the same topic. What news sources are you using? How did you hear about them? I use NPR because I grew up on it - I love their feature pieces but use it for news as well. NBC and BBC pop up the most on my news feed, so I use them for breaking news, along with Twitter. I also use Atlantic for features. What will you talk about when hanging out with family, friends or colleagues? With some friends, we talk about beats that are important to us individually - race, mental illness, etc. With others, we don't talk about news at all. With my family, we talk about breaking news. What matters to you when choosing a news source? I like NPR because I trust it and I like the unique angles it takes to topics and the interesting people that it finds. The stories are usually not too long - if they're long, they're interactive - and they're well-written, very colloquial. Who do you think is doing news well? NPR has done very well maintaining a niche following, telling the news on the radio and reporting features on the web. What do you hate about the news? I wish I had more time to read pieces, and that I get lost in news articles on topics with which I'm not familiar. 

What problems or trouble do you have when accessing to news or information you want to know? I'm not the greatest multitasker, so I can only listen to audio stories when I'm driving or not doing anything else... and I almost never watch video stories because it requires too much of my attention (or I'm in class). IHow do you fix that? I read, but I usually find myself reading features instead of news. What kinds of news are you most interested in? Anything except sports. I am interested in health and education news.To what extent will you dig into a topic? If I care a lot, I will search the relevant hashtag if it is relevant. 

When you’re trying to understand a new topic, where is the first place you go to figure out what is going on? NPRCan you share with me a piece of news that you read recently and you found interesting or important to you?  I read a piece called ""Why Cambodians never get depressed"" on NPR yesterday. It was interesting to me because it shows how language can affect how we treat an illness. There is no word for ""depression"" in Cambodia, so many Cambodians don't understand depression. 

If you find something interesting piece of news, what is the first thing you do?  I share it with a friend. How do you feel when sharing the news or articles with others? Ready for discussion! Would you consider yourself an expert on any news topic? Education. maybe. 

Are there places where you share this expertise now? No. How would you feel comfortable sharing it? Not really, haha. I'm not the best expert, but I know a lot.&nbsp;",Multitasking - good or bad?,Customer Interview,,
2015-02-03,"Email with Rachel Fobar, Student, Northwestern University","My name is Rachel, and I'm 20 years old. I'm a junior studying journalism at Northwestern. I'm originally from California, and I lived there with my parents and older sister until I moved to Evanston. I usually find information by checking my phone, email, Facebook and Snapchat. (Snapchat stories give you all the super important info like who went out last night lol). These usually give me information about things in my personal life. As far as more general world information, I rely on news sites and my AP mobile app. I usually skim headlines from my AP mobile app for world news. If I hear about something particularly relevant or interesting, I will search the topic in Google news. For Northwestern news, I have a Google alert, I scan through all the boring emails, and I listen to what other NU students are talking about.I feel like I'm doing something important when I skim the news, because I feel like it's my job to stay informed. I also feel like I'm helping save my future profession (yes, singlehandedly) when I read the work of other journalists. I spend little time on world news but anywhere between 10 and 30 minutes on NU news.I use whatever news sources come up first in the Google news search. As far as NU news, I check North by Northwestern (I heard about it by writing for them) the Daily in case we missed anything. When I'm done talking about myself (which can take a while because I like talking about myself), the news that comes up with my family or friends is often sexual assault-related. Title IX and assault on college campuses is a huge topic right now, and I also write about it a lot, so it's relevant to me.Trustworthiness of a website is really important to me – I like reading news sites with established names (Associated Press, New York Times, Time, etc.). I also value a certain level of intelligence. For example, it really bothers me when I go on sites geared toward women . They usually use a million exclamation points or say ""this celebrity did this thing IN THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE,"" which drives me crazy. I hate it when female-oriented publications write in the style of a 12-year-old's diary entries. I think Vox does news well because of the explainers in addition to the straight news. I hate the childish tone many women's publications use (see above).Sometimes when I search a story on Google, only unreliable sites pop up. It's hard to tell if the story even happened when the only site reporting on it is some random place like ""omgnewz.com"" I don't really know how to fix that, other than searching either specific news sites for the story or by searching Google news.I'm most interested in women's interest news and sexual assault/Title IX news. I honestly won't usually dig too far because I'm strapped for time (unless I'm writing about it).I usually use Google news – not really a specific place. I recently read about the Vanderbilt football players convicted of rape in the Washington Post. I thought it showed some sort of progress that these players are actually getting convicted instead just reprimanded.After reading that, I went and talked to someone about it. I feel informed and important! YayI'm not sure if I'm an expert, but I feel pretty informed about Title IX and sexual assault. There's definitely still a lot I don't know though.I share it by writing for North by Northwestern. I feel somewhat comfortable talking about it, and I feel comfortable writing about it.&nbsp;","Differentiating from Google, Google News (what is that current experience vs. our product experience?)",Customer Interview,,

2015-02-03,"Email with Jiwon, Student, NU","1.Background of yourself: Age,
job, hobbies, interests.Age: 24Job: Graduate
studentHobbies: watching
TV/youtube, reading, photography, bikingInterests: travel,
zombie movies, design, pop culture, cultural studies2.Walk me through your day in terms
of how you get information about the world and your media habitsI wake up. Turn off
alarm and play with my phone for about 10-20 minutes in bed: checking emails,
Instagram, and FacebookAt school I browse
through Facebook newsfeed in classes on phone or laptop. If I see interesting
videos or article links, I watch/read those right away or bookmark them for
later reading.I mostly get
information about what is going on in the world through social media, which
maybe why I am so behind current affairs nowadays. I won't know any current
issue if none of my ""friends"" mention/link it on social media.I rarely do web
search outside of social media, but I would search on Google for things I would
like to know more about. If one of my friends mentioned something about a
recent terrorist attack on his status, I would do outside search outside to
learn more about it.I log into my
LinkedIn account time to time, but only stay there to accept or request
connections. I never really get or search for information at LinkedIn.I watch American
dramas on Hulu or Netflix (but mostly Hulu) and Korean shows on Youtube. Hulu
and YouTube are the only platforms I actually get to watch (or get forced to
watch) any current advertisement. I don't watch videos with my phone; I always
watch videos on bigger screen (either laptop or Ipad)3.What will you talk about when
hanging out with family, friends or colleagues? What do others talk about?With family, I
mostly talk about my life in America and how I am doing and ask them about how
they are doing in Korea.With friends, I
would talk mostly about how I am doing and want to hear about how they are
doing and what is going on in their lives. We would talk about all kinds of
things: from the latest celebrity crush, hair tips, to the fear of job search
and dying alone.With
colleagues/classmates, I would talk mostly about classes and assignments.4.How do you get your news?
Newspaper, TV, radio, online(social media & content websites), mobile apps?
How did you hear about those news sources?From social media
(mostly Facebook) and class readings. Or from conversations with friends or
classmates.5.When did you start using them?I started using
Facebook since 2007 and have been active on it since 2009, when I was a college
freshman.Joined LinkedIn a
while ago but have been active since 2014.Facebook used to be
the media channel I was most active and visible but now I just use it to talk
to my friends/classmates and browse for interesting things. Nowadays I am most
active and visible on Instagram, where I am exposed to less people whom I
actually have relationships with.6.When you’re trying to understand
a new topic, where is the first place you go to figure out what is going on?Google.7.What is your favorite way to
consume news? Is it listicles, infographics, photos?I like Buzzfeed
because it's fun but I don't expect serious/credible information from there.I like short video
clips and those work the best (better than photos/images) when they were made
well.But I would say
photos/images is my favorite way to consume news, because I can pace myself.8.How do you feel when consuming
media? How does it help you in your daily life?I feel overwhelmed.
There are just too much to consume. I would bookmark everything that seems
interesting but I never have time to go back and actually read those. So I end
up just reading easy and short pieces which tend not to have substantial
information in them.9.How long will you spend on
reading news?Less than 3 minutes
per article.10.What kinds of news are you most
interested in?celebrity gossips,
social experiments, interesting marketing campaigns with good causes, immigrant
issues, women issues, social justice, travel, k-pop11.What matters to you when choosing
a news source?credibilityvisualclean and easy to
consumeintersting contentreadability12.What do you hate about the news?
What problems or trouble do you have when accessing to news or information you
want to know? How do you fix that?I hate it when the
news only has words and too much of them.My problem with
information consumption is that it gets harder and harder to choose the right
platform where I know I would get a selection of unbiased, well-balanced
news/information.I also feel unsure
about the trend of curation because I don't want to only know about things I
am/would be interested. I want to know what is the most important
issues/happenings of the world today that I should be aware of.13.To what extent will you dig into
a topic? What is your consideration when deciding how deep you wanna go?I would dig in if I
get interested in the topics.The visual
execution of topic/article is very important for me to get interested for more
information.14.If you hear some news you would
like to know more, what would you do?Google or YouTube.15.If you read an interesting piece
of news, what is the first thing you do?Bookmark them so
that I won't lose them.16.How do you feel when sharing the
news or articles with others?I won't share it on
my Facebook unless I feel very very very strong about it or I am sure it won't
offend anyone or not harm my reputation/image.I personally find
it uncomfortable about being too opinionated on social media.",,Customer Interview,,

2015-02-02,"Email with Maura Dentino, Nursing Student, New York University","-I'm Maura, I'm 21 and I'm a nursing student. I currently work as a receptionist. I like reading, watching cartoons and drawing.-Honestly I wake up most days, get online immediately and start reading. Keeps me awake. Often times I go onto reddit either for news articles or whatever strikes my fancy that day. I'm then online for a lot of the day after that, either on my phone or the computer, mostly for school purposes. -I mostly get my news online, either on Reddit or the NY Times. Occasionally I'll pick up a newspaper if it's around. On the rare occasion I'm watching TV I'll catch a bit of the news. I never really thought about how I feel when I'm consuming media. I guess sometimes I feel powerful since I have so much information at my fingertips. Other times it's overwhelming how obvious the biases in the media are and it makes me want to rant and rave. I generally spend an hour or two on the news, sometimes less if it's a busy day. -I like to talk about the recent movies/tv shows I've seen, something I've read recently, something funny or stupid I saw on the street that day. Most times that will lead to disjointed rambling about something vaguely related.-I want a news source that tries to minimize or at least acknowledge its biases, though sometimes i think it's almost necessary to read something with an obvious slant, especially one that you disagree with strongly. Keeps things interesting. Keeps you thinking. -I think the news is doing a good job branching out into different mediums and reaching out to a broader audience, though it sometimes comes with the sacrifice of quality.-I hate that the news is biased. I hate how the news focuses mainly on all the horrible things happening in the world. Sometimes the plain truth is so obscured stupid opinions and poorly thought out arguments when I just want to know what's going on, not what some random dude thinks. I try to fix it by trying to go to different news sources when looking into a particular story. Makes it feel more balanced and real.-I like reading news about places far away from me I guess. As awful as most of the stories I read are, I feel it helps me be a little more worldly. I also like reading news related to animals (particularly extinct/endangered ones) and archeology. -It depends how interested I am. I can lose interest in a topic quickly too. If it's a big topic, I tend to go to Wikipedia first to get a basic idea of what's going on and go deeper from there.-I recently read an article about this ""megamouth"" shark that washed up on a beach in the Philippines that I thought was pretty interesting. Weird shark stories are always good. A lot of times when I find an interesting piece of news I want to go tell someone about it. I can be pretty bad at naturally bringing it into a conversion, so it might just come out as ""Yo, look at this crazy-ass shark!!! Are you looking?""-Sometimes I feel a little self-conscious sharing articles with others as it will suggest what I'm really interested in and what my beliefs might be. But most of the time when I'm sharing news with something I'm too excited or enraged about it to care what they might think of me.-I don't consider myself an expert on any news topic. My knowledge is pretty broad for now.","Bias and slants may be something to investigate: ""I want a news source that tries to minimize or at least acknowledge its biases, though sometimes i think it's almost necessary to read something with an obvious slant, especially one that you disagree with strongly.

 ",,Customer Interview,,
2015-01-25,"In Person Meeting with Michael, Student, N/A","How
important to you is staying informed?It’s fairly important.  I’m very curious and love learning new
things.  Ya, also a little bit of wanting
to sound like I know what I’m talking about.Would
you consider yourself an online news reader? 
Why?Not exactly, but I do spend a lot of time
online.  Just never been much of a news
guy.How
often do you read the news online? How long per session?I’d say I probably read at least the abstract
from some news article every day, but don’t stay up with news as much as I’d
like to.  Session times vary wildly
depending on my mood/what’s going on in my day.Do you
read non-news articles instead?  If so,
answer following for those:Ya, I love to read articles online.Where
are you?  Home or mobile?I mostly read at home, but will read on my
laptop and phone depending on where I am. 
Use some apps on my phone to keep me busy on public transportation, etc.What are some reasons you read?  How do you choose what to read?  What source?I read when I’m bored
or when I see a link to something online – facebook or reddit.  It’s mostly what other people show me or
what’s trending, but every once in a while there’s a topic I know about that
I’ll follow.  Sources are usually from
reading online – spend a lot of time on reddit/similar sites – and seeing what
people post.  But otherwise tend to go to
websites whos url I recognize.Do you frequent any particular websites?  Why?For “news” not really,
but ya.  It’s mostly to kill time, I like
seeing new/interesting things to kill time. 
Do engage a little bit, but not a regular poster and never really link
to outside content.Are there any particular qualities about these websites
that make them stand out?It’s really just that
I like the stuff I see there.  Interface
matters but not that much – think about reddit.If it took less time would you read more?Oh ya for sure.  I know it’s a weak excuse, but I often find
myself wishing I had more time to read etc.If it was only most important information would you read more?Ya.  I’m not usually looking for a ton of info –
just the most important selling points. 
I actually guess I like looking for info when I feel like the article
illuminates something contrary to popular opinion.  I just end up getting more involved and
feeling like I wish I could show everyone.If it was only certain types of content would you read more?Maybe, but that’s not
necessarily a good way to do it.  It’s
not really industry specific or anything like that, just kind of whatever seems
interesting at the time.Under what circumstances are you likely to read an article?Any time I see an article
that might be interesting I open it in a new tab.  I’ll then read part of it and either finish
it later or close it.How likely are you to share content you’ve found?Not very.  I see a lot of new content all the time, so
unless it’s truly exceptional I really won’t get involved.  I guess I do share a lot just not a high
percentage of what I see.When would you share and to whom?Every once in a while I’ll
save an article that I know is really good and share it with my friends/family
when I think of it.  But usually if I don’t
share it right there and then it’ll never happen.What is your favorite media type now (video, text, infographic)?I think I really like a mix
of options.  Like of investopedia does
it.  Sometimes I just want to read and
other times I really like to sit backand have a video going in the background. What would be the ideal way for you to stay informed, given no
restrictions?I’d probably have a person I trusted write down the most
important topics and the most important nuggets from each and then personally
walk me through them so that I could ask them questions/engage with them if I
wanted.","There's at least some people who would consume more if it were easier to find the ""most important information"" - overwhelmed by too much, doesn't know what to read.  Reaching users at the right time is key: even the more active users often passively consume the news.  News is becoming a social construct; engagement increasingly important.",Customer Interview,,
2015-01-25,"In Person Meeting with Lucas, Student, N/A","How
important to you is staying informed?Not very important.Would
you consider yourself an online news reader? 
Why?No, not general news.  It’s just not interesting, and staying
informed isn’t important.  Distrust for
journalism – “not factual, more sensationalist”How
often do you read the news online? How long per session?Not very often, and short sessions.  Typically from newsletters, etc.Do you
read non-news articles instead?  If so,
answer following for those:Yes, mostly about events related to music.Where
are you?  Home or mobile?Almost entirely at homeWhat are some reasons you read?  How do you choose what to read?  What source?Mostly goes to
specific websites for music-related news, then probably from social
media/friends.  Article title is really
important, otherwise needs a recommendation.Do you frequent any particular websites?  Why?Yes. Loyal customer to
these sites.  Believes information is
professional and reliable.  Aesthetic
design.If it took less time would you read more?No.  It’s not about the time, it’s just the
content.If it was only most important information would you read more?No, not interested in the
content at all, really.If it was only certain types of content would you read more?Yes.  Content is pivotal.Under what circumstances are you likely to read an article?Almost certain to read it
depending on relation to friend. 
Otherwise, title of article very important and what is going on at the
time – e.g. might be inappropriate and in public How likely are you to share content you’ve found?Depends, but more than
likely yes.  If there’s something I like
I can probably think of someone else who would like it too – I like sharing
with friends.When would you share and to whom?Probably immediately via fb
to close friends.What is your favorite media type now (video, text, infographic)?Video is preferred, but
depends on context.  If in a hurry, text
is better – infographics and images better.What would be the ideal way for you to stay informed, given no
restrictions?Honestly hardly care about being informed.  Doesn’t like listening to the news (different
than a video) – so ideally would have just a newspaper or something.","To non-news readers, journalism can be a ""dirty word,"" associated with sensationalism.  Content matter is pivotal for some consumers, generally staying in the know has no value.",Customer Interview,,

Tell me a little about yourself? Age, job, hobbies, interests.26, grad student, cooking, learning languages, traveling, reading, DIY craftsWalk me through your day in terms of how you get information about the world and your media habits.Twitter, Facebook, I get NYT daily email in my inbox, I also search for marketing related articles online by just googling, Buzzfeed (for culture news? procrastination), Korean websites like Naver.com, I rarely watch TV, only stream videos on Youtube or Netflix, instagramWhat will you talk about when hanging out with family, friends or colleagues? What do others talk about?I think this is a bit broad - it really depends on the person and the occasion so it is impossible to answer this question... in my opinionHow do you feel when consuming media? How does it help you in your daily?Yes, it is helpful but often I feel overwhelemed by how much information is available. I get lost easily, finding a lot of things interesting but not having enough time to consume it all - also I think my attention span is very short when it comes to online mediaHow long will you spend on reading news?Maybe 15 - 30 mins a dayWhat kinds of news are you most interested in?International news - esp relating to my home country. News about new technology, health are also of interest. What news sources are you using? How do you use them?  How did you hear about those news sources?  When did you start using them?I think this is also similar to the previous questions. When it comes to ""worldly news"" I get it through the NYT daily email. Also, lots of hot topics are now available as ""trending"" news on twitter and facebook. For updates on family/friends, I rely a lot on facebook. I have ""lists"" on Twitter where I arranged a list of people who are experts in Marketing analytics so I go through what they post there. NYT email I started getting maybe 2 years ago. Facebook I had since 2007. Twitter only recently (like this year 2015) I started to use as a substantial source of news.What matters to you when choosing a news source?Accuracy, the way they present the news is interesting (make it relevant for me). Also, I liked a page called NOWTHISNEWS on facebook. They are really cool cos they make ~15 sec videos for their news. Very easy to consume and engaging than having to read an articleWhat do you hate about the news?  What problems or trouble do you have when accessing to news or information you want to know? How do you fix it?Not too much. I don't like it when it is repetitive (CNN would repeat something over and over again on TV and website), also when it is not presented in a consumer friendly way (no pictures, long articles, bad structure)To what extent will you dig into a topic? What is your consideration when deciding how deep you wanna go?Depends. If it is an event, I try to cover the Who what when where why. If it is a more technical topic, it depends on how much I find it interesting or how much I think it will benefit me.Can you share with me a piece of news that you read recently and you found interesting or important to you?Uber + American Express partnership  - important to me because I have to work on an article to post on Huff Post for the Spiegel Research Center (lol)What is the last piece of news you wanted to do more research about?  Did you do the research?  If not, what prevented you from doing so?  If you did, how did you do more research?Same as the question above. I did the research because I needed to have expertise in the topic to be able to write a blog post regarding the topic. Googled the topic, went to the two companys' websites, read a couple of articles under the Google News tabIf you hear some news you would like to know more, what would you do?I would try to look for it myself by googling (if korean news I would go to Naver). I like Naver because it not only brings up articles and websearch but also blog posts, community posts, and related topic words when I search. I get a better idea of what other people are thinking/saying about the topic.How do you feel when sharing the news or articles with others?I try to stay away from sensitive topics (politics, religion). I feel like I am sharing something useful to others, that others might also find to be ""cool"" or ""interesting"".Would you consider yourself an expert on any news topic?  Are there places where you share this expertise now?  If not, would you be willing to share with others?  How would you feel comfortable sharing it?I am trying to portray myself as an expert of marketing analytics on twitter (for Randy's DiSoMo class. it is kind of a quarter long assignment...). Twitter, because my other social media websites (facebook and instagram) are more private. Twitter is public so it can reach the entire world whereas for instagram and facebook it is just my school friends.What is your favorite way to consume news?  Is it listicles, infographics, photos?While infographics are cool, I don't think they are capable of telling the entire story. Therefore, video would be my favorite way. Next would be succinct, well written, relevant articles

I wake up in the morning and half groggily look at my phone and I have The Guardian and NPR and The Times installed on my phone so I get the same breaking news alerts pushed to my phone (kind of annoying)Get a bunch of Newsletters (read Quartz daily brief, scan twitter, read Times headlines) while still in bed (vogue news apps - timeline, mostly pretty but don’t get much out of it)Used to listen to morning edition on NPR, radio brief, not so much anymore because I walk with boyfriend to workCan you walk me through your day yesterday? Probe if finding something interesting.
Twitter, email newsletters (catching up on newsletters), reading a bunch of stuff on Instapaper, wasn’t actively looking for new newsI like newsletters because I’m in my email anyway and it’s easier, usually subscribe to ones with people I’m interested following, Media Redefined (in a space relevant to my interests and work)Via Twitter - app called Nuzzle (scans your timeline for how many of your friends have tweeted about an article, when it’s reached a threshold it emails that article to you and shows you tweets about it, what people said about it)
Can change frequency (24 hours), show you the article and people who also liked this storyIt’s cool - since I follow a lot of news nerd people, I feel like stuff that’s relevant that’s happening I won't miss out on that wayMost things people I follow who tweet out stuff I find interesting anywayHow do you get your news? Newspaper, TV, radio, online(social media & content websites), mobile apps?
Newsletters - I feel like people I would be interested in reading their newsletter they shamelessly promote their stuff that they writeI’m not quite as bad as Shaq (story about Shaq at CES and buying a lot of new apps every week) but I look at editors picks and recommended apps on App Store from time to time if I’m bored - while I’m getting rid of alerts I look at top new noteworthy appsHow do you feel when consuming media? How does it help you in your daily life?
I feel informed, more connected to certain groups of people for example having come from journalism can follow the stuff they’re talking about or reading, a lot of the times it’s stuff I’m interested in or working on so it makes me think differently about certain things which is good and other times it’s just “oh cool interesting”What will you talk about when hanging out with family, friends or colleagues? What do others talk about? 
Beyonce, restaurants I want to try, work that I’m doing (how other publications are approaching how they make money or start and build their brand, tools they need), talk a lot about the Warriors now, tell dad jokes, talk about news-y things and current event things (zero women at DAVOS - world economic forum, really archaic but influential), television shows●News (specifically):
How long will you spend on reading news? 
It’s not like a “I need to sit down and read news now” but it’s more of an ongoing thing throughout the day so it’s hard to say (until I get my Vanity Fair magazine which will be exciting)A lot of the time newsletters I’ll save them for the weekend (Brain Pickings, Ann Friedman, only send on weekends)Use RescueTime for browsing habits - I spend 6% of my time on news and opinion (~2 hrs) only on computerSporadically throughout the dayWhen I’m at work during the week it’s mostly on my computer, but when not at work it’s all on my phone (evening, morning, out and about, weekends)What kinds of news are you most interested in?
A lot of analysis and opinion (not breaking news or politics - unless it’s SOTU when I feel like I have to care), puppies, basketball, entertainment stuff, culture (trends)Don’t care about at all but everyone cares about: weather (bitching about blizzard on East Coast)What news sources are you using? How do you use them?  How did you hear about those news sources?  When did you start using them?  
The Times because everyone reads it, NPR because I worked there and I like listening to audio, Ann Friedman (editor at GOOD where I worked, big web writer and writes culture column for NY Mag, writes for Columbia Journalism Review, very opinionated and has a lot of lady swagger so I like reading her)I read Nieman Lab every dayI subscribe to Five Intriguing Things by Alexis Madrigal because it’s less personal (HotPod and podcast space which has been kind of interesting, This.cm), Media Redefined, NYT has this thing “what we’re reading”Instapaper weekly - top read things, less breaking news but more of “what people are reading”Self-selecting group of small news nerds I follow on Twitter, I hear about news sources through word of mouth, personal connectionsWhat matters to you when choosing a news source?
Easy to read, writing about things I care about, do they have typos if so I won’t read them, legitimacy, what they’re reporting is interesting and compelling, does it look nice (does it hurt my eyes to look at it), voice is pretty strong for me (NYT has distinct style of writing, following certain media columnists have developed their own writing style and voice especially reading more opinion and analysis stuff)What do you hate about the news?  What problems or trouble do you have when accessing to news or information you want to know? How do you fix that?
Sometimes it tries to be too dumbed down, too listicle-like and not the news sources I read but for big things that happen a lot of reposting (few pieces of original stuff anymore, but blurb of what’s already been written and posting it as a new thing), super insular and echo chamberyWho do you think is doing news well? 
SB Nation (sports more entertainment-y) good balance of here’s the stuff that’s happening, live updates, but is also fun and obviously image-oriented and Vines and I feel it’s really compellingNYT Now - I like it a lot but feel there is a long way to go, more to do with personalization, used to be fewer stories and things, I think it’s interestingCan you share with me a piece of news that you read recently and you found interesting or important to you?
I read this thing about why you should read literature from NYT, blog that’s called Gray Matter about philosophy and literature, evidence that reading things that are more literary and less “here’s the bare bones facts” encourages people to think more creatively and actually changes something in their brainIf you hear some news you would like to know more, what would you do?
Google it or search on TwitterIf you find something interesting piece of news, what is the first thing you do?  
Usually send it to Instapaper and from there highlight it, don’t share a lot of things anymore, but sometimes if it’s relevant I’ll email it to someoneHypothetically, how likely are you to create a new profile/ account for a new news service?  LikelyWould you be willing to rate a story’s usefulness after you read it? Pretty willingWho do you trust most when reading your news?  NYT, journalists I follow on TwitterWould you consider yourself an expert on any news topic?  Are there places where you share this expertise now?  If not, would you be willing to share with others?  How would you feel comfortable sharing it?  
NoWhat is your favorite way to consume news?  Is it listicles, infographics, photos?
Text as long as it’s well written, images, infographics I rarely take time to invest cognitive effort, listicles I’m not into them","Consuming news is not like a “I need to sit down and read news now” but it’s more of an ongoing thing throughout the day. Newsletters may be interesting to look at because users are already in their email and may find it easier to consume content that way. Personal connections are important in choosing articles to read, newsletters to subscribe to, discussions to engage in (and almost all come from Twitter).",Customer Interview,,
2015-01-25,"Phone Call with Elizabeth Koh, Metro News Intern, The Washington Post","●Why don't we start with you telling me a little about yourself? Age, job, family members, hobbies, interests.Elizabeth Koh, 21, student currently but going to be an intern Washington Post, two parents and younger brothers (sophomore in college, junior in HS), read and write a lot (medical anthropology, science, Paul Farmer, New Yorker, Marshall Project), occasionally listen to music, mostly journalism●News, Websites, Apps (generally):As a consumer of news, can you walk me through how you typically consume news? Specifically, how did you consume news yesterday?  
Wake up, first thing I do is reach for the phone, go through news alerts and handful of mobile apps (NYT, WaPo, BBC, CNN - ew) - at a certain point they’d all overlap, mostly see if anything breaking happens, check email in morningsWill do a really quick morning read and once I get up and log into my computer I check a couple of social networks (majority of my life is on Facebook and Twitter, various parts throughout the day)Smaller sites like MinnPost and Texas Trib, investigative news outlets go to homepages and (after I go through intermediary social networks and alerts that are more easily accessible)Consistently checking news throughout the dayHow do you feel when using it? What do you think could be improved?
A little difficult in that there are a lot of entry points, I don’t necessarily know if condensing them into a single entry point is something I would want to Number of different perspectives (news orgs most worthy of attention, journalists) - valuable part even if it takes a lot of time to go through stuffAdding additional context, how to verify breaking news as it happens (pipedream, but as a journalist would love to see that in a breaking news site - Reportedly)Trove - used to be WaPo Labs then into separate company, creating a single content news-sharing website and building partnerships with a variety of news organizationsGotten used toDifferent because it’s brain intensive and feels like a task as well as multitasking - integrate the way news comes in in a way that is non intrusive as possibleProfession (specifically):
Walk me through your career in journalism: where did you start and how did you get here today?Started in high school because I needed an elective, worked for a couple years on high school paper, continued working on college paper as freshman in BrownInternship at actual paper was Texas Tribune (Wendy Davis summer), lot of policy reporting, criminal justice and environment teams (areas in which I focus when I’m looking for news on a day to day basis), investigative work in DC (nonprofits and WaPo)Did a little bit of work for independent study project last semester working with news orgs and focusing on how to file FOIAs and documentsHow did you decide to become a journalist?
Worked on a story sophomore spring (2013) had a student go missing in the middle of March and was missing for 40 days, Boston Marathon bombing happened, Twitter and Reddit - people thought missing student was the bomberNot sleeping the whole night, seeing comments on university newspaper flood with all of these comments, identified actual suspects morning after and ended up finding missing student’s body in river week after thatHad wanted to be a journalist for a long but didn’t know if I could actually do it, story changed a lot of things for me and made me realize that I always wanted to do foreverWere you professionally trained in journalism? 
No journalism major at Brown, in terms of training has been from working in university paper and internships, journalism classes few and far between (professor who worked at - did independent study and taken classes with her)Are you a full-time journalist or also working on other non-journalist projects? 
Full-time student, wouldn’t necessarily I’m a full-time journalist (no newsroom right now)Early June start at WaPo - working on MetroWhen you’re doing research for a story, what sources do you use? 
Working on a couple of investigative stories for investigative desk, spent a lot of time doing microfilm digging at national archives, metro - weekend shifts for local desk and was mostly checking crime databases and court records (identifying people in breaking news stories, calling police departments and county clerks, public document records)Texas Trib - environmental reporting - didn’t have much experience in environment-oriented, relying on a lot of university sources (could call experts in the field), a lot of bureaucrat stuff - environment quality, chairs of various environmental advocacy orgs across the state, foundations (spent a lot of time talking to those who worked for departments on a day to day basis)When publishing a story, is there background info that you wish you could share with your audience? 
Journalists feel that about every single story, most of the time information doesn’t go into story (ethics or not enough things)A lot of the technical detail for policy or why things work the way they do, don’t know what kind of readership would be for that thoughHow do you determine if a story you write is or isn’t successful?
For investigative story, measure impact by people as managed to hold accountable, if actual government action is taken in response to storyMeasure how well feature has done (reader comment and feedback, whether it moved them - very vague and fuzzy way of measuring if a story is successful), personal aspect to this, if i’ve done a good job telling a storyWhat do you find most satisfying about being a journalist?
Having a license to be as nosy as possible and ask as many questions as you canYou can jump into one world and see how everything works, you’re not fenced into one particular thing, you can jump from story to story people to people, living life to the fullestWhat do you find most frustrating about being a journalist?
Frustrations I have with journalism aren’t different than normal jobs - politics within the workplace ,budget constraints, freedom to write the stories you want or do the assignments you always want to do, minor enough to me that they aren’t frustrationsWhere do you see journalism going in the next 1, 3, 5, 10 years?
Next 3-5 years still going to be grappling with same questions, how to make journalism economically feasibleWhat will journalism look like in 3-5 not years? Big believer in non profit journalism, feel like there is this trend (tech executives) people who have a lot of money, buy legacy media investing in public service, think it’s too early to call in the jury as to whether their motives are pure and what execution of that should look like, whether or not legacy media orgs or new media orgs will end up being dependent on individual titans of industry investing in work these places are doingFeel like the success story people come back to the Texas Trib - very specific audience with very jingoistic perspective on what matters to them, not necessarily translatable to other fields and larger scale What about digital and technology excites you about where the profession is headed?  Frustrates you?  
I think it’s amazing - threshold is higher in that Real challenge for journalists is not being scooped by other journalists but beings cooped by code, threshold for new journalists is how do you bring the skills necessary to visualize information for readers or conduct computer assisted reporting - journalism is a little more difficult (thought it was talking to people but there’s also this increasing emphasis to be able to wield these tools)I don’t feel like I could get a job if I didn’t know a little bit of this stuff, even then I don’t feel comfortable with it because my curriculum doesn’t cover itNecessary part of toolkit younger journalists might have trouble picking up, institutional knowledge might have hard time understanding and taking time to learnAre there any digital products that have helped you do your job better? Worse?
Twitter falls in both categories just because it’s necessary for breaking news but lack of verification necessary for good journalismExcel Access make reporting easier, platform to analyze data, RTableau, post on social media to assess what happened where for breaking newsHow much time per week do you spend on promoting your stories?  How do you promote them?
Will probably just take a little bit of time (half a minute) to write a Facebook post and put it out thereDo you use social media channels for professional reasons?  How active are you on social media professionally?
Twitter almost entirelyFacebook rely a lot on privacy settings, things i want to curate for professional audience i make publicVaries whether or not whether I’m in a newsroom, not currently working on stories so don’t post on Twitter, would usually tweet multiple times a day while working on stories, Facebook I use in a social context pretty stable levelWhat do you like most and least about these channels?  Twitter/ Facebook/ Pinterest?  
Already a built in audience just a matter of getting them to pay attention to your storiesIntuitive, easy to understandDifficult to control, very messy, take attention away from news storyWould you be willing to add another social media tool to help you professionally?  
Depending on what it is, I would be open to itHypothetically, how likely are you to create a new profile/ account for a new news service?  
I would put myself at slightly less likelyAre there places where you share your expertise now outside of your publication?  If not, would you be willing to share with others?  How would you feel comfortable sharing it?  
I don’t because I don’t think I have any expertiseWhat other journalists do you respect, follow, admire?
Journalists everyone follows because they’re Ezra Klein, follow specific reporters at Politico or NYT who do location specific bureau work I find particularly interesting, good work from Boston Bureau or congressional reporting (tweets informal conversations with congressman, lots of color and consistent tweeting)  Where do you go to find in-depth news stories?  
Longreads hashtag and website, couple of news orgs like Marshall Project, ProPublica, occasional feature depending on where they’re runDo you link out to other journalists work in your work?
For sure especially if you’re referring to someone else’s reportingWhat are your thoughts about exploratory journalism?
Both categories exist, can be done really well, can be done really badlyYes and no would read news in that space, when I think about good explanatory journalism I like stuff that provides interesting color and policy and impact, when I think about less clean exploratory journalismHow do you think journalism can do a better job of monetizing their products?
Little I know comes from experience at Trib, question of diversifying revenue streams because subscriptions won’t hold up foreverWhat recommendations do you have for improving today’s news?
I think people should consume more of it from better outletsNews consumer cares about the content - people don’t care enough about local reporting or state-level (seeing reporting and resources dedicated to reporting falter most)Ideal news consumer - make them care about that kind of reporting, difficult to get out of the cycle when you don’t have resources to cover state reporting that those questions and issues are thereDifficult for people to take policy reporting and anchor it in day to day color that would matter to a reader - policy stuff can be really really dull (even I get tired of it after awhile and I call myself a news junkie)Throw as much money as possible to reporters and keep them reporting stuff that is substantive","What is challenging about the current news consumption experience is that it ""feels like a task as well as multitasking."" What is appealing about journalism is that ""you’re not fenced into one particular thing, you can jump from story to story, people to people."" In the context of breaking news, social media streams are both useful and detrimental (content is surfaced quickly but verification is very difficult). Voice and ""different perspectives"" are important for hyperlocal news and making certain topics like policy more readable and informative to consumers.",Customer Interview,,
2015-01-25,"Phone Call with Gabe Bergado, Entertainment Fellow, Mic","●Why don't we start with you telling me a little about yourself? Age, job, family members, hobbies, interests.Gabe Bergado, 22, finished up a fellowship at Mic (new media startups), from California (SoCal), family is mom sister and I, television/internet/food of all varieties●News, Websites, Apps (generally):
As a consumer of news, can you walk me through how you typically consume news? Specifically, how did you consume news yesterday?  
Found through social media, on Twitter and Facebook links - follow publications and like publications, a lot of those stuff I see comes directly from those pages showing up on my dashboardI have friends who share links on each others walls, couple sites I go to their website (Vulture, The Atlantic front page)How do you feel when using it? What do you think could be improved?
Kind of annoying, once you start going to a site’s page the Facebook algorithm sends you more of that content, wish it was a little more equal in terms of pages I likeEventually on Facebook create a feed simply for the publications I like and everything, think sometimes some publications do better to market their content on Twitter and Facebook (interested in how places get traffic from social channels, why aren’t shares more interesting, using technologies to their best - video and photo on Facebook)Seeing publications bring more attention to content using Facebook 
Profession (specifically):
Walk me through your career in journalism: where did you start and how did you get here today?
Liked writing before going to college, journalism school (struggled at first didn’t have a background in it), a lot of the classes taught useful lessons but weren’t necessarily geared towards what I’m interested in, definitely refined my reporting skills ubt kind of started covering viral content and entertainment (internships have helped me with that)First internship before college was at a reality television production company, learned more about television and his background in thatWorked at Northwestern Media Relations, first big internship in terms of editorial was at Mashable (viral content, web culture, entertainment team), student publications during undergraduate career were also really important to me (editor → editor in chief) applied lessons from the classroom,Interned at Popular Science as a web intern, got to do a bunch of different editorial things (writing, social media, video)Graduated and did a little of freelance work, got a fellowship at Mic and was their entertainment fellow (3 months), now I am waiting to hear back from some places I’ve applied, looking at freelance stuffHow did you decide to become a journalist?
AP English Language and Composition - really liked it and did well in that class, I applied to a variety a colleges and majors and so got into NU Journalism school and it was really well-known and decided to go there, committed to it and in terms of writing journalism seemed the most stableDidn’t ever expect Were you professionally trained in journalism?  
MedillAre you a full-time journalist or also working on other non-journalist projects? 
FreelancingWhen you’re doing research for a story, what sources do you use? 
Depends on the story, hyperlocal look at my own network, if it’s more featurey and less hyperlocal I use Google as a research tool, looking for official sources (professors, researchers), jot down things I think I know then When publishing a story, is there background info that you wish you could share with your audience? 
Definitely is sometimes, but since I’m in the realm of online journalism I can always hyperlink to that information, if people are more interested in a topic you can hyperlink and interested readers will follow that trail you leave for themHow do you determine if a story you write is or isn’t successful?
Metrics - online traffic tends to count a lot, but not very useful to look atBe proud of the work that you do, if it creates a discussion or how well-reported it is, depends on scope of the story (breaking news vs. evergreen servicey piece), what criteria you’re looking atWhat do you find most satisfying about being a journalist?
Really engaging with your content, either laughing at it or learning something new you didn’t know, great when readers of the content actually reach out to you on Facebook or Twitter specifically rather than commenting on it (cool when the reader actually finds you and contacts you personally, most satisfying part)What do you find most frustrating about being a journalist?
Definitely the pay, industry is really underpaid, especially in today’s world (online) it’s so competitive in terms of sites (traffic) it kind of sucks the ethics in terms of headlines are changing, biggest frustrations at Mic just being a new media startup were obsessed with traffic, weird because I never really thought of myself as that serious of a journalist, seeing those ethics waver really brought out my true feelings as an enforcer of the truthWhen mainstream pieces get things wrong and don’t own up to it, only tell one side of the story (CNN and Ferguson)Where do you see journalism going in the next 1, 3, 5, 10 years?
Personal essays on the rise, will continue to beA lot of people reading things with a good voice, personal accounts, especially when there are so many choices you can go for news nowadays, people will start to tailor their interests where they can trust the news and a little more than just the news (voice, analysis, new way to approaching news), where a lot of big places like NYT and WaPo are trying to figure outHow the next generations are going to consume news/want to consume newsWe’re going to see definitely just how social media changes (definitely will affect news), nobody goes to webpages natively anymore, a lot of people consume news (online news) through social channelsWhat about digital and technology excites you about where the profession is headed?  Frustrates you?  
Really interested to see augmented reality - how that might change news, might totally bust (Google Glass not produced anymore), opportunities for thatEveryone has a smartphone nowadays obviously, so I think the next thing in technology is 3D printing and wearable tech but don’t necessarily think they will have a big impact on journalism and news Are there any digital products that have helped you do your job better? Worse?
Chartbeat great for analytics (analytics tools are really important, also think they sometimes aren’t productive because sometimes sites will get too cuaght up in what brings in the most traffic and will start to shy away from other other types of content that should be covered but don’t share well for us), Google AnalyticsLot of tools like TweetDeck and Chartbeat looking at social trends, building lists and ways to attract what content’s doing wellVideo sites implementation, video content is really helping, explosion of BuzzFeed Video on Facebook and super big right now and shareableHow much time per week do you spend on promoting your stories?  How do you promote them?
Depends, I’m also still a new journalist so I think I’m very picky in promoting my own stories (just because I’m also createa  brand where I’m funny and stuff, will share serious things if it’s important to me or it fits)Sometimes I leave it up to whatever site I”m working for to promote my content, sharing content on Twitter easier because more volume of traffic in terms of content eveyr minute, more picky on Facebook with things Do you use social media channels for professional reasons?  How active are you on social media professionally?
Yes definitely, I think I also in terms of Facebook - a story I wrote then change my setting (public facebook is different from what my friends can see), status like brand of being funny make public so other people can see, any articles I share are public too (when my friends comment or like, it’ll pop up on other people’s newsfeeds)Twitter - similarly I am using professionally to reach out to other people, give shoutouts to sources I’ve talked to or interact with other journalists to talk about a story they shared or whateverWhat do you like most and least about these channels?  Twitter/ Facebook/ Pinterest?  
Think it’s nice you can tailor what you want to follow, also detrimental because you don’t get to see content (new kinds of content)You see content you’re interested in and follow but don’t see new kinds of contentNews orgs can’t put all content on Facebook so it’s almost a competition fo whose stories are going to get shared on social and stuff which I think creates a weird dynamic Would you be willing to add another social media tool to help you professionally?  
Yeah - I use Tumblr (very low click through rate), post visuals and important parts of article, using also Instagram is interesting (hard just because you can’t share links on instagram as well)Something I’m interested that frustrates me is news orgs are using reddit to promote themselves, very specific community and against self promotion, places don’t think about that sometimesHypothetically, how likely are you to create a new profile/ account for a new news service?  
YeahMore outlets weren’t using Vine? Huge way to connect with youth especially, younger generations are more on Vine than Facebook (data shows), I like downloading all of them (Ello - interested to see what it was, adopter of new technologies)Are there places where you share your expertise now outside of your publication?  If not, would you be willing to share with others?  How would you feel comfortable sharing it?  
Just with friends sometimes, I know a lot about issues of gender and sexuality in television and sometimes when watching TV with friends we’ll discuss thingsNot so muchWhat other journalists do you respect, follow, admire?  
Ann Friedman - personal essays and womens’ issues still relatable, Connor and holiday parties and holiday party hookup really funnyReally like this freelance writer Alex Jung Vulture writes a lot about Asian issues in television, different kinds of Asian men on television, how each one is typecasted into several archetypesBuzzFeed Anne Peterson - features on pop culture thingsWhere do you go to find in-depth news stories?  
NYT, BuzzFeed is doing features and longform pretty well, sometimes check out Longreads Twitter or Facebook page to see what they’ve sharedWhen friends post Longreads I’ll save them in my Pocket app to read laterDo you link out to other journalists work in your work?What are your thoughts about exploratory journalism?
Explainers on topics are good, for complicated issues like Syria and Egypt people don’t really know where to start with their quesitons sometimes they’re good if they’re broken down really well (written in chunks)List is a very strong format in terms of consuming stuffI feel explainers are also really consumable, useful, as long as you build on top of them too it’s usefulHow do you think journalism can do a better job of monetizing their products?
Brand and content on the rise right now, I think branded content should be taught in j-schools because journalism at its core is hopefully objective but so many things make it subjective (the writer, who they choose to approach at a crime scene or event, creating strong editorial content for brands is really interesting (as long as it’s very clearly labeled as branding or sponsored content)Brings more of a theme around it, GE did a campaign at Mic and helped sponsor content for stories relating to stories about the brain, packaged together around a theme but not necessarily promoting GE products in each of those stories, can be carried to other products news sites serve like videos and infographicsWhat recommendations do you have for improving today’s news?
Wish traffic did not matterJournalism world is so homogenous, really frustrating, need diverse newsrooms","As a new journalist, image and personal branding is very important. Twitter and Facebook are both avenues for curating and consuming content, as well as a way to mold one's image. However, social media sites like Facebook use algorithms that promote more things you already follow and don't allow for a lot of discovery in new types of content. Branding and sponsored content can be used to monetize news products but can also produce great bundled content under a specific theme. Personal connections are important, such as when readers contact journalists personally to produce a sense of accomplishment or content like personal essays that are on the rise as people try and seek news sources with a more unique voice and more analysis.",Customer Interview,,
2015-01-20,"Email with Melody Kramer, Digital Strategist and Editor, NPR","Alex DunerHi Melody—I’m working in a class on developing a news product and was wondering if you had any time this week to chat. Hope Sadie is doing well and you are enjoying your vacation! What’s the best way to set up a time to talk?Melody KramerI’m actually heading to Chicago for #ordcamp - would it be possible to chat on gchat right now?Alex DunerYou're coming to Chicago!Melody Krameryes! for ordcampAlex DunerFun!So I'm in this class where over two quarters we basically have to make a business of some sort. My team is working on something in news and I wanted to get your insight into some of the questions we are figuring out.Melody Kramersure.Alex DunerFirst can you tell me a bit about your background in news? (also, congrats on the new job, btw)Melody KramerIt's a new digital agency within the federal government.And they act as consultants to the rest of the federal government and help the agencies solve digital problems or fix something that could be made more efficient.And I'm on a two-year term appointment.I don't know my exact assignment yet.Alex DunerCan you talk about your history with NPR a bit? We're trying to have a base set of info about the people we interview.Melody KramerSure. This might help. This is my bio: http://www.melodyjk.com/about/Alex DunerPerfect.Melody KramerI have worked as a director, producer, editor, writer, digital strategist, product manager and reporter for NPR.over the past 8 yearsmost recently, I led projects from conception through technical completion that either made NPR connect in a better way with the audience or made NPR more informed about its presence in the digital spaceAnd work portfolio is here: http://www.melodyjk.com/portfolio/Alex DunerWhat we are trying to make is some sort of platform that lets journalists share their expertise about a topic; sort of like a Pintrest for News. I know that at NPR you worked a lot to get reporters using social media in innovative ways. What sorts of challenges did you have trying to get people on new platforms?Melody KramerWell, any new platform requires a time investment, so people want to know how it will make their workday more efficient.or save them time, or provide them with X, which they couldn't otherwise obtain.There's also a learning curve with any new platform.And folks are often under deadline, so they want something quickly and that they can trust.Alex DunerHow does information about these platforms tend to spread within a newsroom?Like are there key people who if you get them on board, it causes a cascade?Melody KramerWell, it really depends.Sometimes, yes.But I'm not sure people want 500 different platforms.so most people have adapted to something and I think would find it difficult to integrate something new -- unless it easily integrated with what they already use, or it was mandatory, or it changed their life in some major way.Early adapters are often keybut so is seeing a resultI know people also find out through their kids.Snapchat entered the newsroom through people's kids.Also, there's no one size fits all. There are many different units within a newsroom.And a solution for one desk might not work for a different desk.Alex DunerOne of the things we are trying to help reporters surface is archived content about current news stories. We want to give them a way to compile the expert sources they use when writing a story. How does NPR leverage that when breaking news today?Melody KramerCan you give an example?Bombing happens in X. What does this platform do?Alex DunerSo, for example, say there's a great article from three years ago about French culture and islamophobia there. How do you find that today and share it as part of your coverage of the Charlie Hebdo attacks?Does that make sense?Melody KramerEither through tagging, doing a search on the NPR website, or a Google search.Alex DunerWould you ever link to stories on another news site in that case?Like say that great article was in the WSJ?Melody KramerNPR generally links to member stations, but I haven't noticed them doing something like that -- like the way the NYT does on their front page.I think what you're describing is kind of like what Google does at the bottom of search, where it pulls up really good related articles.on the bottom of the first page of search results.Alex DunerYes.We just want to have it be more curated by people, not an algorithm. Do you think that's something people want/need?Melody KramerSo a little module of related stories?Alex DunerExactly.Melody KramerKind of like what Facebook is trying to do?Alex DunerA little bit. Hmm. We'd also want them to be embedable within stories.Melody KramerI think some news orgs. would like it and some wouldn.tAlex DunerCan you elaborate?Melody KramerIt depends on a) what sources are deemed acceptable b) who vetted (on some websites, I imagine they wouldn't want to link to certain news websites), c) what value that provides to them as a businessIf it means people see them as a place with good curated content, then people return. If it's a module that sits on every news site and people don't associate the curated content with the original place, then it's sending traffic elsewhereSite A has the module. Site B has the module. Site C has the module. What's the value for site A? The value of the NYTimes module, I think, is that you trust it was curated by NYTimes people.Alex DunerI think what we are thinking is that as part of the platform, anybody could curate one of these modules, both news orgs and individual journalists.Melody Kramerthat's smart.And then a news org. could choose a module by person A?Alex DunerAlong with anybody else who has topic expertise, and then we'd use a Reddit style voting system to surface the best ones, but any module could be embedded anywhereExactly.Melody Kramerthat's smart.could the modules be updated?Alex DunerYes.And potentially collaborated onMelody KramerI think a news org would be hesitant if a module could be updated to XXX sites or somethingwhat stops that?Alex DunerI don't think I understand the question?Melody KramerI create a module with helpful links. It's posted on the NYTimes. Then I change my module links to be sex sites.Alex DunerAhh.That's an interesting point.How do you get in depth information about news stories?Melody Kramerme personally? I go to Reddit.Alex DunerInteresting. What do you like about Reddit?Melody KramerHere's another thing: I create a module and the links go dead. A news org accounts for their internal links when updating. If the links go dead, do they disappear? Is it okay to have dead links? How do you indicate when the module was created / updated?lots of different people / lots of good information quickly / good stuff surfaces to the top and I can find lots of perspectives.Alex DunerAnd yeah, those are good questions we need to figure out.Are journailsts on reddit?Does that change how much you trust the content? (using a broad definition of Journalist here)Melody KramerNot in large numbers as ""journalists""no, it doesn't. The community vote / size of the community does that for me.Alex DunerWho do you think is doing a good job of providing additional context to complex stories today?Melody KramerIt really depends on the story. Like, there are a few journalists / people doing an amazing job on Ferguson.@ShaunKing, @deray, and @Nettaaaaaaaa.I found them after others had recommended them.And I saw them retweeted in my stream.Alex DunerOooh I've been following @ShaunKing and @deray, I'll have to follow @Nettaaaaaaaa.Given that it depends on the story so much, how do you find the people who are experts?Who are providing that perspective?Melody KramerIt's hard.Sometimes I see them retweeted somewhere.but there's no definitive list saying ""These are the people to follow for X""Alex DunerCan you describe your daily news consumption?You've touched on Twitter and RedditMelody KramerIt's mainly through Twitter and Reddit. I will glance at a local main page if breaking news happens.I prefer a local reporter in X location to a national publication. I will just google ""Ferguson + paper""I also read The New Yorker cover to cover.but Twitter / Reddit / listservs are my main source of news.Alex DunerAre you happy with that system?Melody KramerI am because it's giving me a variety of perspectives from people I trust.I often have a Tweetdeck column open to see how someone else gets their news.Alex DunerThat's interestingMelody Kramerhttp://socialmediadesk.tumblr.com/post/80011124459/social-sandbox-social-media-stuff-state-of-theAlex DunerI think one of the things we want to do is surface the sources that journalists use when reporting, which is similar. Do you know if that's common?Melody KramerI'm not sure.Alex DunerYou've been doing a series about how people not in the news get their news. One of the questions you've been asking is ""what do you hate about the news"". Are there any common themes you've noticed?Melody KramerYes. People hate people who don't fact checkand people who fill time on network broadcasts with unsubstantiated rumorsAlex DunerDo you have any other thoughts about ~explanatory~ journalism? (I think that's kinda the niche we are trying to be in)Melody KramerI tend to follow people and not publications.I read essays in all sorts of smaller niche publications.and I don't mind that they're not in like an Outside or Vogue.I suspect I think more like the audience in that respect, but I also suspect editors might be more likely to go with a Vogue.Vogue standing for major publication with reputable historyAlex DunersureMelody KramerI think I was thinking Vanity Fair and said Vogueis Vogue fashion?I don't know.Alex DunerI think that's basically all my questions. Is there anything else about barriers to entry on social networks or this space that you think we should know about? Think about? People we should reach out to?Melody KramerI think there are similar modules on sites like Clickhole and The OnionI think barriers will be: people worried about how links can change -- and how the content at those links can change, and how this ultimately makes people care more about their brand.If I'm X person, can every news org. put my module on their site?Alex DunerThat makes sense.Well thanks so much for your time, this was really helpful.Melody Kramerthanks Alex. It's a good idea. Looking forward to seeing how it develops.Alex DunerThanks! Enjoy ordcamp","There were a couple key insights from Melody that we learned. First, she had some interesting insights about getting people in a newsroom to adopt new social platforms, as that was one of her roles at NPR. She said, ""I'm not sure people want 500 different platforms. So most people have adapted to something and I think would find it difficult to integrate something new -- unless it easily integrated with what they already use, or it was mandatory, or it changed their life in some major way. Early adapters are often key, but so is seeing a result...And folks are often under deadline, so they want something quickly and that they can trust.""

She also mentioned a few competitors: ""I think what you're describing is kind of like what Google does at the bottom of search, where it pulls up really good related articles...Kind of like what Facebook is trying to do?""

When it comes to reading the news, Melody likes sources like Reddit, with ""lots of different people / lots of good information quickly / good stuff surfaces to the top and I can find lots of perspectives."" On certain stories, she finds that she follows certain people who provide a good voice and good information, sometimes they are trained journalists, other times they are informed citizens.

Regarding potential challenges, Melody said: ""I think barriers will be: people worried about how links can change -- and how the content at those links can change, and how this ultimately makes people care more about their brand.""",Customer Interview,,

Macao, casino news, whatever beat im covering. Then I open BI email, we get research reports from banks and look for something interesting. Look for catchy headlines like “oh blackberry!” then I open up BI and then wallstreet journal. I use tweetdeck over twitter, its calm. Twiitter overwhelms me. BI, tech, home, etc. I get a lot of news for FB. Most of the stuff i see on FB is articles. recode, NYmaganize, NYT, chicago business, BI, wired, the atlantic, wallstreet J, new yorker, USA today

Oh thats a new angle, never thought to cover it that way, “media is most rewarding when it changes the way i think about something”. Entertainment.

How do you fix that?People dont care about what there supposed to care about, they click on shit that doesnt matter, and ugggggh some things you cant make sexy. slideshows make me dumber…. comments are dumb. audiences are dumb.

I remember reading about deflate-gate. I learned about it on facebook actually (its more like gossipy). I go on FB for two reasons (to see the trending topics) and because im bored. Once I saw the headline I didn’t care much because it was patriots. But then i went on ESPN and saw it was a big deal. I also heard a lot of comedians make fun of it… which i enjoyed.I remember reading about the windows 10 keynote as well.
